It's so funny when I download DeepSound and then RANDOMLY download DeathGrips.mp3 to encrpt the files. Then I Listen the song and I hear "Password", "Password", "Password"
thought for a second, there is a glitch in the software. Realized it's the Rap Music.

Its an encryption software! It hides the files behind a music file.

So its like a way to hide your files on computer?
Or can you disguise an executable as an audio file
And put a rat into the mp3 file or something

It's not a RAT, its an encryption + hidden file way. It encrypts and hide behind a  music file
